## Description
The core idea of the project is to alert the user of drastic price changes and provide real-time market data. The alerts set by the user can help him to enter or close a trade based on his trading margins. These alerts can be set by the user on simple messaging platform like Telegram. The bot is developed using Bot Framework SDK and deployed on Azure Bot Service.
